    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Hello! I’m <span className="font-semibold">Farrel Rafael</span>, a passionate <span className="font-semibold">Web Developer</span> and a dedicated <span className="font-semibold">Cybersecurity Learner</span> based in Indonesia.
      My journey into the world of technology began with a deep curiosity for how things work behind the scenes — from how websites are built, to how they can be protected from digital threats.
    </p>

    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
      As a web developer, I specialize in creating elegant, responsive, and secure web applications using modern technologies such as <span className="font-semibold">Next.js, Tailwind CSS,</span> and other full-stack tools. I’m particularly focused on writing clean and maintainable code that not only functions well but is also aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>

    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
      My interest in <span className="font-semibold">cybersecurity</span> emerged from a desire to build not just functional, but also safe digital experiences. I’ve been actively learning about secure coding practices, HTTP headers, input validation, CVE exploitation, and ethical hacking principles to better understand how to safeguard applications from common vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
      Beyond code, I enjoy collaborating on meaningful projects, exploring open-source contributions, and diving deep into the intersection of design, functionality, and security. My mission is to become a well-rounded developer who can deliver solutions that are both visually compelling and technically robust — with security in mind.
    </p>
